        <h1>Html</h1>
        <p>HTML stands for HyperText Markup Language. "Markup language" means that, rather than using a programming language to perform functions, HTML uses tags to identify different types of content and the purposes they each serve to the webpage.
        <br><br>HTML is at the core of every web page, regardless the complexity of a site or number of technologies involved. It's an essential skill for any web professional. It's the starting point for anyone learning how to create content for the web. And, luckily for us, it's surprisingly easy to learn.
        <br><br>Markup languages work in the same way as you just did when you labeled those content types, except they use code to do it -- specifically, they use HTML tags, also known as "elements." These tags have pretty intuitive names: Header tags, paragraph tags, image tags, and so on.
        <br>Every web page is made up of a bunch of these HTML tags denoting each type of content on the page. Each type of content on the page is "wrapped" in, i.e. surrounded by, HTML tags.
        <br><br>Using HTML, you can add headings, format paragraphs, control line breaks, make lists, emphasize text, create special characters, insert images, create links, build tables, control some styling, and much more.</p>

        <p>HTML provides the raw tools needed to structure content on a website. CSS, on the other hand, helps to style this content so it appears to the user the way it was intended to be seen. These languages are kept separate to ensure websites are built correctly before they're reformatted.
        <h3>If HTML is the drywall, CSS is the paint.</h3> 
            <br>Whereas HTML was the basic structure of your website, CSS is what gives your entire website its style. Those slick colors, interesting fonts, and background images? All thanks to CSS. This language affects the entire mood and tone of a web page, making it an incredibly powerful tool-and an important skill for web developers to learn. It's also what allows websites to adapt to different screen sizes and device types.</p>
