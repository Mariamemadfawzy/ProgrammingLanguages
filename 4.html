        <h2>C++ Language </h2>
        <img src="https://www.watelectronics.com/wp-content/uploads/cprogramming.png">
        <p>The C++ language has an object oriented structure which is used in large projects. Programmers can collaborate one program into different parts or even one individual work on each part of the program. The structure of object oriented also permit code to be reused many times.This language is an efficient language. But, many programmers will disagree</p>
        <br>
        <h2>C Language</h2> 
        <img src="https://www.watelectronics.com/wp-content/uploads/C-Language.jpg">
        <p>The C language is a  basic programming language and it is a very popular language, particularly used in game programming, Because C language includes the additional packing of the C++, Every programmer uses this language because it makes programs faster . However the value of this language gives the reusability of C++ to get the slight increase in performance with C language.</p>
        <br><h2>Java Language</h2>
        <img src="https://www.watelectronics.com/wp-content/uploads/java-logo.png"width="200" height="200">
        <p>The Java language is a multi platform language thatâ€™s particularly helpful in networking. Of course, mostly this language is used on the web with Java applets. However, this language is used to design cross platform programs, Since it similar to C++ in structure and syntax. For C++ programmers, Java language is very easy to learn and it offers some advantages provided by object oriented  programming. Like reusability and it can be difficult to write efficient code in Java. But, nowadays the speed of the Java language has increased and 1.5 version offers some good features for easy program making.</p>
